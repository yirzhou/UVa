- [x] 343B (similar to bracket matching - find "++" or "--")
- [x] 1294D
- [x] 322B (such a weird one: only if `a % 3 == 0 && a >= 3 && b % 3 == 2 && c % 3 == 2` will we add 1)
- [x] 1251C (reduced to "given a list of odd digits and a list of even digits, reorganize them so that their relative order doesn't change and the final number is minimised")

## Needs Revision

### 03/11/2023

- 1336A
- 1398C
- 1352G
- **1526C** (very simple and beautiful solution in the end)
- 1358C (draw the diagram and figure out paths where the current path is longer by 1 than its previous path)
- 1334C (think about the additional bullets required if we do NOT kill its previous one)
- 235A (intuition is to iterate all triplets within [n-50,n])
- 1497C1 (odd, n%2 but n%4 != 0, and n%2 and n%4 == 0)
- 1389B (was on the right idea - the maximum pair part is tricky: `mp[i]` can also be `nums[i]+nums[i+1]`)
- 1396A (the trick is to realize that the first number can be added with 0)
- 1348A (three cases, greedy)
- 1458A (solved on my own after knowing `gcd(x,y) == gcd(x-y,y)`)
- 1342C (solved on my own after knowing `(x % a) % b == [(ab + x)% a] % b`; given the small constraints on `a` and `b`, we only test numbers within `[0, ab-1]`)

### 03/18/2023

- 510C (almost solved it but I neglected a corner case)
- 1519D (expand from the center)
- 1165D (my initial approach was similar: computing the LCM of all, and check if number of divisors is the same as array length; the key is to realize `x = nums[0] * nums[n-1]`)
- 1374E1 (actually easy - just greedy)
- 1327C (ridiculous problem - bounded by the `2nm` which implies that it is always possible; snake-like traversal)
- 1395C (just do complete search given the low constraint `2^9`)
- 1371D (think about how to evenly distribute the 1's across all rows and columns)
- 1305C (the constraints are very tricky - if `n > m` then there must be duplicates, causing the final product to be zero)
- 1503A (a beautiful problem that tests my thinking - eventually realize that for all `1`s, we need half of them to be left and the other half to be right, so we construct them first)
- 1364C (I didn't see `0 <= ai <= i` - _need to come back to this_)
- 1514C (the sequence cannot contain a coprime)

### 03/31/2023

- 1527C (the key is to compute the sum of prefix sums for a number at an index `i`)
- 1542C (LCM... check out [this post](https://blog.csdn.net/tkkdouzi/article/details/118877468))
- 1603B (intuition is to imagine a number line for the case `x <= y`)
- 1475E (use 0-1 knapsack at initialization)
- 1513C (a really tough one - notice if the digit is already `10`, the resulting number of digits after `i` operations)
- 1303C (greedily check `pos+1` and `pos-1`)

### 04/09/2023

- 1455D (when we see `nums[i] > x` we need to swap; otherwise, we cannot swap it with `nums[j]` where `j>i` as `nums[j]` will become `x` but `nums[i] > x` and it won't be sorted.)
