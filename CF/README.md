- 1336A
- 1398C
- 1352G
- **1526C** (very simple and beautiful solution in the end)
- 1358C (draw the diagram and figure out paths where the current path is longer by 1 than its previous path)
- 1334C (think about the additional bullets required if we do NOT kill its previous one)
- 235A (intuition is to iterate all triplets within [n-50,n])
- 1497C1 (odd, n%2 but n%4 != 0, and n%2 and n%4 == 0)
- 1389B (was on the right idea - the maximum pair part is tricky: `mp[i]` can also be `nums[i]+nums[i+1]`)
